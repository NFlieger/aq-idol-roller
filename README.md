ZG Bijou Roller
--------------------------------------

This addon rolls NEED, GREED or PASS on bijous and coins dropping in Zul'Gurub.

This can be configured by typing:

* /bijouroll need
* /bijouroll greed
* /bijouroll pass

The default behaviour is greed and is used after every ui reload so you have to think every ZG ID again on how to roll in that group.
