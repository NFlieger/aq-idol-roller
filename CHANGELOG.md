Seperate rolls for coins and bijous added:

* the old commands (/bijouroll [need|greed|pass]) still work the same as before
* by default the roll behaviour for coins is locked to the behaviour for bijous
* to unlock the coin rolls, use /zgroll [c|coin] [need|greed|pass]
* to lock the coins again, use /zgroll [c|coin] lock

Command line parameters (like need, greed and pass) are no longer case sensitive.

Versioning in ZGBijouRoller.toc fixed.
